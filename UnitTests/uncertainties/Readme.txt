Test 1 and 2 use SLSUnique with no "collected data" uncertainties. There are different SLS weightings for these.
Test 3 uses inverse and has no "collected data" uncertainties.
Note: Test 3 has two possible outcomes: one if the uncertainties modules is present, and one if it is not. no "collected data" uncertainties.
Test 4 uses inverse and has collected data uncertainties as well as the absolute uncertainties feature for the reference file, based on the 'auto' uncertainties feature. This data is particularly not noisy, so the error is not that much increased.
Test 5 uses the collected data uncertainties and the reference data uncertainties for the SLS.
